# DGBall

This is a 2d football game made in Vanilla JS.
The game is at the moment only available for Desktops and for 2 players playing on the same machine.

## Motivation

What motivated me to create DGBall was the challenge of coding a game from scratch, including the psyshics like collisions.
Furthermore, this variant of the game is not final. Some of the features that I wish to implement in future variants are: 
  - Online mode to play with friends
  - Mobile support

## Technologies used

The game is made in Vanilla JS.
It is made as a SPA in order to improve performance.
